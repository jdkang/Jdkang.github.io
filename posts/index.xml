Specifically in my case, a visually impaired person. The hope is this will (a) make it easier for anyone in a similar situation and (b) help improve processes long-term for the disabled.
Although the CKA is a Linux Foundation exam it is proctored through PSI.
To be very clear: my interactions with individuals from both the Linux Foundation and PSI were extremely positive.</description></item></channel></rss>
